###### Sydney ######
**Sydney is famous for its beaches.** Mostly Bondi Beach but there are so many other great (better in my opinion) beaches scattered all along this coastal city and **with Sydneyâ€™s perfect climate it is warm enough to be visiting the beaches about eight months of the year.** A large amount of my life has been spent on the beaches of Sydney.

### Code Fencing ###
> Usually, the monotone property is find either by instinct, print out the DP table, or by Monge condition. 
> Actually, divide and conquer optimization is a special case of 1D/1D convex/concave Knuth optimization(cost function doesn't depends on previous DP values).
