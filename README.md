###### Sydney ######
**Sydney is famous for its beaches.** Mostly Bondi Beach but there are so many other great (better in my opinion) beaches scattered all along this coastal city and **with Sydneyâ€™s perfect climate it is warm enough to be visiting the beaches about eight months of the year.** A large amount of my life has been spent on the beaches of Sydney.
